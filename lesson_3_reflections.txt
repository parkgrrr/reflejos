When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When it is a simple or trivial change, or fix a merge conflict, or something like that.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because if an automatic pull happens when your in the middle of writing unfinished code it could ruin what you are working on
