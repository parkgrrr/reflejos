When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When it is a simple or trivial change, or fix a merge conflict, or something like that.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because if an automatic pull happens when your in the middle of writing unfinished code it could ruin what you are working on



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork - on github when you are modifying someone elses project and want to ackknoledge it

clone - a straight copy of a repo onto your machine

branch - tracking changes in a repo seperately from other changes
