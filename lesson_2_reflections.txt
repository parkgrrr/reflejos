It was helpful to quickly pinpoint the differences

hi

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a git folder is created with metadata that will track stuff.  you need it for the initial commit idk

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

idk only add the relevant files to the staging area


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?


It would be super helpfull when experimenting and adding new code while at the sametime trying to maintain a stable branch.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

AUTO IS cool because it tries to play it safe and makes common sense merges.  Manual is cool because you can make sure the code is just how you want it to be
